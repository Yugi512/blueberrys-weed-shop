// this button is the buy or checkout button on the whole cart page
// this will lead to the stripe payment page or to the payment page if we decide to just use stripe as a component and then decide to create our own with our own forms and stuff like that
// a button that will be implemented in the div that will have the total for all thats in the cart
// when process goes through will redirect to a page that says successful
// and then there will be a receipt and email with order details and stuff
// and then it will update the inventory and then make it so that the users profile will reflect the order and its status
// this kinda stuff will be implemented after we finish with fixing up all the other projects and making them presentable on our resumes
